  <img src="ss1.PNG"></img>

  <h5> The peasant in Song dynasty lived a poor life, the only path for seeking a better life is through standardized examination  </h5>
  <h5> In the Song dynasty (960â€“1279) the imperial examinations became the primary method of recruitment for official posts. <br>The examinations were opened to adult Chinese males and more than a hundred palace examinations were held during the dynasty</h5>
  <h5>  The exam required candidates to compose a logically coherent essay by juxtaposing quotations from the Classics or sentences of similar meaning to certain passages.<br> This reflected the stress the Song placed on creative understanding of the Classics.</h5>
